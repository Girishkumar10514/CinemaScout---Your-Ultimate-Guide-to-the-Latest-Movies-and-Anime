\section{NETFLIX-a referencial application}
Netflix is a popular streaming service that allows users to watch TV shows, movies, and documentaries on demand. Founded in 1997 as a DVD-by-mail rental service, it has since evolved to become one of the most popular streaming platforms in the world. With over 200 million subscribers in over 190 countries, Netflix offers a wide variety of content for its users to enjoy.

One of the key factors in Netflix's success has been its focus on original content. The company has invested heavily in producing its own TV shows and movies, including popular series like "Stranger Things," "The Crown," and "Narcos." By creating its own content, Netflix is able to differentiate itself from other streaming services and offer unique and exclusive content to its users.

In addition to its original content, Netflix also offers a vast library of licensed movies and TV shows from other studios and networks. This includes popular series like "Breaking Bad," "The Office," and "Friends," as well as a wide range of movies in various genres.

Netflix is also known for its personalized recommendations, which are based on a user's viewing history and ratings. The company uses machine learning algorithms to analyze user data and suggest content that is likely to be of interest to them. This helps users discover new content and makes it easier to find something to watch.

Another feature that sets Netflix apart from other streaming services is its ability to offer different subscription plans. Users can choose between three different plans: basic, standard, and premium. The basic plan offers SD quality streaming and allows users to stream on one device at a time. The standard plan offers HD quality streaming and allows users to stream on two devices simultaneously. The premium plan offers 4K Ultra HD quality streaming and allows users to stream on up to four devices at once.

Netflix has also expanded its offerings beyond traditional TV shows and movies. The company has produced a number of popular documentaries, including "Tiger King" and "Making a Murderer," as well as stand-up comedy specials featuring comedians like Dave Chappelle and Ellen DeGeneres. It has also dabbled in interactive programming, with shows like "Bandersnatch" and "You vs. Wild" allowing users to choose their own adventure.

Finally, Netflix has been a pioneer in the way it distributes its content. In addition to streaming, the company has experimented with releasing entire seasons of TV shows all at once, rather than airing episodes weekly. This has become known as the "binge-watching" model and has been adopted by other streaming services and networks.

Overall, Netflix has revolutionized the way we consume and enjoy TV shows and movies. Its focus on original content, personalized recommendations, and flexible subscription plans has made it a popular choice for viewers around the world.

Launched in 2006, Amazon Prime Video offers a wide range of movies, TV shows, and original content for users to enjoy. With over 200 million subscribers worldwide, it has become one of the most popular streaming services in the world.

One of the key features of Amazon Prime Video is its vast library of movies and TV shows.

In addition, Amazon Prime Video has licensed content from various studios and networks, including HBO, Showtime, and CBS.

Another feature that sets Amazon Prime Video apart from other streaming services is its focus on original content. The service has produced a number of critically acclaimed original series, including "Transparent," "Mozart in the Jungle," and "The Man in the High Castle." It has also produced original movies, including "Manchester by the Sea" and "The Big Sick." In addition, Amazon Prime Video has expanded its offerings to include live sports, with coverage of the NFL, NBA, and MLB.

Like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video also offers personalized recommendations based on a user's viewing history and ratings. This helps users discover new content that they are likely to enjoy. In addition, Amazon Prime Video offers a feature called X-Ray, which provides information about the cast and crew of a movie or TV show, as well as trivia and other behind-the-scenes information.

Amazon Prime Video also offers different subscription plans to suit the needs of different users. In addition to the standard Amazon Prime subscription, which includes access to Prime Video as well as other Amazon services like free shipping and music streaming, users can also choose to subscribe to Prime Video as a standalone service. This allows users to access Prime Video without having to subscribe to the full Prime service.

One of the unique features of Amazon Prime Video is its integration with other Amazon services. For example, users can rent or buy movies and TV shows through Amazon Prime Video, or they can use Amazon's Alexa voice assistant to control their viewing experience. In addition, Amazon Prime Video has started offering a feature called Amazon Channels, which allows users to add premium networks like HBO and Showtime to their Amazon Prime Video subscription for an additional fee.

Finally, Amazon Prime Video has also experimented with the way it releases content. Like Netflix, it has released entire seasons of TV shows at once, allowing viewers to binge-watch their favorite series. However, it has also released movies in theaters before making them available on Amazon Prime Video, which is a departure from the traditional streaming model.

Overall, Amazon Prime Video has become a major player in the streaming market, offering a wide range of content and unique features for its subscribers. Its focus on original content, personalized recommendations, and integration with other Amazon services has made it a popular choice for viewers around the world

Other movie websites soon followed, including IMDb (Internet Movie Database), which launched in 1996 and quickly became a popular destination for movie lovers.

Rise of online movie rentals (late 1990s-early 2000s): In the late 1990s and early 2000s, movie websites began offering online movie rentals and downloads. Websites such as Netflix (launched in 1997), Blockbuster Online (launched in 2004), and Amazon Prime Video (launched in 2006) gained popularity, allowing users to watch movies from the comfort of their own homes.

Emergence of movie news and reviews (mid-2000s): In the mid-2000s, movie websites began offering more in-depth movie news and reviews, with websites such as Rotten Tomatoes (launched in 1998) and Metacritic (launched in 2001) providing users with aggregated movie reviews and ratings from various sources.

Streaming revolution (mid-2010s): In the mid-2010s, the rise of streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video changed the movie industry and the way people consume movies. Movie websites began offering streaming services, such as FandangoNOW and Vudu, allowing users to rent or buy movies digitally.

Current trends (2020s): Today, movie websites continue to evolve, with many offering personalized recommendations, user-generated content, and interactive features.
